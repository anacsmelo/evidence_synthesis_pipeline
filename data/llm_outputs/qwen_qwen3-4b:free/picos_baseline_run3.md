Population:  
- Children and adults with autism spectrum disorders (ASD), including those with Asperger’s syndrome and PDD-NOS.  
- Specifically, 2,568 children born in 1994 (aged 8 years in 2002) who met the surveillance case definition for ASD (Study 1).  
- 2,275 individuals with ASD (children aged 0–18 years and adults aged 18–85 years) in the Netherlands (Study 2).  

Intervention:  
- Não reportado.  

Comparator:  
- Sex of the child (male vs. female).  

Outcomes:  
- **Study 1**:  
  - Age at first developmental evaluation.  
  - Age of diagnosis.  
  - Presence of cognitive impairment (IQ ≤ 70).  
  - Behavioral features (e.g., seizure-like behavior, hyperactivity, aggression).  
- **Study 2**:  
  - Timing of identification (age of first parental concern and diagnosis).  
  - Age of diagnosis.  
  - Delay between first concern and diagnosis.  
  - Sex differences in diagnostic timing across subtypes (autistic disorder, Asperger’s syndrome, PDD-NOS).  

Study design:  
- **Study 1**: Secondary analysis of a population-based surveillance study (ADDM Network) with a cohort of 2,568 children.  
- **Study 2**: Cross-sectional survey of 2,275 individuals with ASD, including children and adults, using self-reported data from parents, family members, and individuals with ASD.
