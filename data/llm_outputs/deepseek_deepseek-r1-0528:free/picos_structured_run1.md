**Population:**  
- Study 1: Children born in 1994 who met surveillance case definitions for autism spectrum disorders (ASD) across 13 U.S. sites (N=2,568; 81% male). Racial composition: 63% White, 23% Black, 10% Hispanic/Asian/American Native, 4% other/not stated. Subtypes: autistic disorder, Asperger’s disorder, PDD-NOS.  
- Study 2: Individuals with ASD in the Netherlands (N=2,084; 81.5% male), stratified into children (0–18 years, N=1,354) and adults (18–85 years, N=730). Subtypes: autistic disorder, Asperger’s syndrome, PDD-NOS.  

**Intervention:**  
- Não reportado.  

**Comparator:**  
- Study 1: Sex differences (male vs. female) in ASD identification patterns. Cognitive impairment (IQ ≤70 vs. >70) was analyzed as an interacting factor.  
- Study 2: Sex differences across diagnostic subtypes (autistic disorder, Asperger’s syndrome, PDD-NOS) and age groups (children vs. adults).  

**Outcomes:**  
- Study 1: Age at first developmental evaluation, presence of documented ASD diagnosis, age at ASD diagnosis, and behavioral features (e.g., seizures, hyperactivity). Girls without documented diagnoses had higher rates of seizure-like behavior; boys had higher hyperactivity/aggression.  
- Study 2: Age at ASD diagnosis and delay between first parental concern and diagnosis. Girls with Asperger’s syndrome (children) and women with autistic disorder (adults) had later diagnoses than males. No sex differences in PDD-NOS diagnosis timing.  

**Study design:**  
- Study 1: Secondary analysis of population-based surveillance data (Autism and Developmental Disabilities Monitoring Network). Case status determined via clinician review of educational/clinical records using DSM-IV-TR criteria.  
- Study 2: Cross-sectional survey study using self-reported data from the Dutch Autism Society. Linear regression analyzed diagnosis timing, controlling for current age and age of first concern.
