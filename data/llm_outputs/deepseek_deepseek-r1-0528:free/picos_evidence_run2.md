### Population
- **Study 1**: Children aged 8 years (born in 1994) meeting ASD surveillance criteria across 13 U.S. sites (n=2,568; 81% male, 19% female). Subtypes: autistic disorder, Asperger's disorder, PDD-NOS.  
- **Study 2**: Children (0–18 years) and adults (18–85 years) with ASD in the Netherlands (n=2,275; 81% male, 19% female). Subtypes: autistic disorder, Asperger's syndrome, PDD-NOS.  

### Intervention  
Not reported.  

### Comparator  
- **Study 1**: Males vs. females in ASD identification patterns. Cognitive impairment status (IQ ≤70 vs. >70) examined as an interacting factor.  
- **Study 2**: Males vs. females stratified by age group (children <18 years; adults ≥18 years) and ASD subtype.  

### Outcomes  
#### Age at First Evaluation/Diagnosis  
- **Study 1**:  
  - No sex difference in mean age at first developmental evaluation (males: 46 months; females: 47 months; p-value not reported).  
  - No sex difference in mean age at ASD diagnosis among those with documented diagnoses (males: 61 months; females: 59 months; p-value not reported).  
- **Study 2**:  
  - **Children (<18 years)**: Females with Asperger's syndrome diagnosed later than males (females: 9.7 years; males: 7.9 years; p<0.001). No sex differences for autistic disorder or PDD-NOS.  
  - **Adults (≥18 years)**: Females with autistic disorder diagnosed later than males (females: 16.2 years; males: 15.3 years; p<0.05). No sex differences for Asperger's syndrome or PDD-NOS.  

#### Likelihood of Documented ASD Diagnosis  
- **Study 1**:  
  - Males more likely to have a documented ASD diagnosis than females (59% vs. 54%; OR=0.76, p=0.004), adjusted for cognitive impairment.  
  - Girls with IQ≤70 less likely than boys with IQ≤70 to have a documented diagnosis (OR=0.70, 95% CI=0.50–0.97, p=0.035).  
  - Girls with IQ>70 less likely than boys with IQ>70 to have a documented diagnosis (OR=0.45, 95% CI=0.32–0.66, p<0.001).  

#### Behavioral Features  
- **Study 1** (among cases without documented ASD diagnosis):  
  - Females more likely to have seizure-like behavior (p<0.001).  
  - Males more likely to have hyperactivity/short attention span (p<0.01) and aggressive behavior (p<0.01).  
- **Study 2**:  
  - Longer mean delay between first concern and diagnosis for females vs. males (2.3 vs. 1.9 years; p<0.05).  

### Study Design  
- **Study 1**: Secondary analysis of population-based surveillance data (Autism and Developmental Disabilities Monitoring Network). Cross-sectional design using existing records.  
- **Study 2**: Cross-sectional survey data from a national autism society (self/parent-reported). Stratified analysis by age group and ASD subtype.
