**Population:**  
- **Study 1:** Children born in 1994 meeting Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) surveillance case criteria (n=2,568), aged 8 years in 2002. Males constituted 81% of the sample. Racial composition: 63% White, 23% Black, 10% Hispanic/Asian/American Native, 4% other/not stated. Cognitive impairment (IQ ≤70) documented in 45% of subsample with IQ data.  
- **Study 2:** Children (0–18 years) and adults (18–85 years) with ASD diagnoses (autistic disorder, Asperger’s syndrome, PDD-NOS; n=2,084 after exclusions). Males: 81.4% (children), 74.9% (adults); females: 18.6% (children), 25.1% (adults). Data collected via survey from Dutch Autism Society members.  

**Intervention:**  
- **Study 1:** Não reportado (observational analysis of surveillance data).  
- **Study 2:** Não reportado (cross-sectional survey analysis).  

**Comparator:**  
- **Study 1:** Sex comparisons (males vs. females). Subgroup comparisons by cognitive impairment status (IQ ≤70 vs. IQ >70).  
- **Study 2:** Sex comparisons (males vs. females) stratified by age group (children vs. adults) and ASD subtype (autistic disorder, Asperger’s syndrome, PDD-NOS).  

**Outcomes:**  
- **Study 1:** Age at first developmental evaluation; presence of documented ASD classification; age at ASD diagnosis; behavioral features (e.g., seizures, hyperactivity, aggression). Females less likely to have documented ASD diagnosis (OR=0.76, p=0.004), especially with IQ>70 (OR=0.45, p<0.001). Females more likely to have seizure-like behavior (p<0.001); males more hyperactivity/aggression (p<0.01).  
- **Study 2:** Age at ASD diagnosis; delay between first parental concern and diagnosis. Females with Asperger’s syndrome diagnosed later than males in children (1.8-year delay, p<0.001). Females with autistic disorder diagnosed later than males in adults (4.3-year delay, p<0.05). No sex differences for PDD-NOS.  

**Study design:**  
- **Study 1:** Secondary analysis of population-based surveillance data (Autism and Developmental Disabilities Monitoring Network). Case ascertainment via record review across 13 U.S. sites using DSM-IV-TR criteria.  
- **Study 2:** Cross-sectional survey study. Data collected via questionnaires from Dutch Autism Society members. Linear regression analyses stratified by age group and ASD subtype.
