### Population
- **Study 1**: Children born in 1994 meeting ASD surveillance case criteria (n=2,568; 81% male, 19% female).  
- **Study 2**: Children (0–18 years) and adults (18–85 years) with ASD diagnoses (n=2,084; 81% male, 19% female).  

### Intervention  
*N/A (Observational studies examining diagnostic patterns).*  

### Comparator  
- **Study 1**: Males (reference group for all comparisons).  
- **Study 2**: Males (reference group for all comparisons).  

### Outcomes  
#### Age at First Evaluation  
- **Study 1**: No sex difference in mean age at first developmental evaluation (males: 46 months; females: 47 months; p-value not reported).  
- **Study 2**: Não reportado.  

#### Age at Diagnosis  
- **Study 1**: No sex difference in mean age at ASD diagnosis among those with documented diagnoses (males: 61 months; females: 59 months; p-value not reported).  
- **Study 2**:  
  - *Children (0–18 years)*: Females with Asperger’s syndrome diagnosed later than males (mean delay: 1.8 years; p<.001). No sex differences for autistic disorder or PDD-NOS.  
  - *Adults (≥18 years)*: Females with autistic disorder diagnosed later than males (mean delay: 4.3 years; p<.05). No sex differences for Asperger’s syndrome or PDD-NOS.  

#### Likelihood of Documented ASD Diagnosis  
- **Study 1**: Females less likely than males to have a documented ASD diagnosis (OR=0.76, p=.004). This persisted after adjusting for cognitive impairment:  
  - Females with IQ ≤70: OR=0.70 (95% CI=0.50–0.97, p=.035) vs. males with IQ ≤70.  
  - Females with IQ >70: OR=0.45 (95% CI=0.32–0.66, p<.001) vs. males with IQ ≤70.  
- **Study 2**: Não reportado.  

#### Behavioral Features  
- **Study 1**: Among ASD cases *without* a documented diagnosis:  
  - Females more likely to have notations of seizure-like behavior (p<.001).  
  - Males more likely to have notations of hyperactivity/short attention span (p<.01) and aggressive behavior (p<.01).  
- **Study 2**: Não reportado.  

### Study Design  
- **Study 1**: Secondary analysis of population-based surveillance data (Autism and Developmental Disabilities Monitoring Network).  
- **Study 2**: Cross-sectional survey study (Dutch Autism Society members).
