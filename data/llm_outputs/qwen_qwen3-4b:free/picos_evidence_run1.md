**PICOS Synthesis**  

### **Study 1**  
**Population**: Children with autism spectrum disorders (ASD) born in 1994 (n = 2,568), 8 years old in 2002.  
**Intervention**: Not applicable (observational study).  
**Comparator**: Sex (males vs. females).  
**Outcomes**:  
- Age at first developmental evaluation.  
- Age of diagnosis.  
- Likelihood of documented ASD diagnosis.  
- Cognitive impairment status.  
- Behavioral features (e.g., seizure-like behavior, hyperactivity, aggression).  
**Study Design**: Secondary analysis of population-based surveillance data (ADDM Network).

### **Study 2**  
**Population**: 2,275 individuals with ASD (children aged 0–18 years, adults aged 18–85 years).  
**Intervention**: Not applicable (observational study).  
**Comparator**: Sex (males vs. females).  
**Outcomes**:  
- Timing of identification (age of first parental concern, age of diagnosis).  
- Delay between concern and diagnosis.  
- Diagnostic subtypes (autistic disorder, Asperger’s syndrome, PDD-NOS).  
- Gender differences in diagnostic delay (e.g., Asperger’s syndrome in females).  
**Study Design**: Cross-sectional survey (parental, family, and self-reported data).

**Note**: For both studies, "Intervention" and "Comparator" were not explicitly reported. "Outcomes" and "Study Design" were derived from the studies. "Population" was explicitly defined.
