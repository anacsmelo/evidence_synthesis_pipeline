**Population:**  
- Children and adults (aged 0–85 years) with autism spectrum disorders (ASD), including autistic disorder, Asperger’s syndrome, and PDD-NOS. The sample included 2,275 individuals, with 81% males and 19% females.  

**Intervention:**  
- Evaluation and diagnosis of ASD, including the timing of identification (age of diagnosis, time between first parental concern and diagnosis).  

**Comparator:**  
- Sex of the child (male vs. female).  

**Outcomes:**  
- Age of first developmental evaluation and diagnosis.  
- Time between first parental concern and diagnosis.  
- Presence of specific symptoms (e.g., aggressive behaviors, hyperactivity, seizure-like behaviors).  
- Age of diagnosis in children and adults.  
- Delay in diagnosis for Asperger’s syndrome and PDD-NOS.  

**Study design:**  
- A survey with a large national sample (N = 2,275) of individuals with ASD. Data were collected from parents, next of kin, and individuals with ASD themselves. A series of stepwise linear regression analyses were conducted to examine sex differences in the timing of diagnosis.

**Population:**  
- 2,568 children born in 1994 (aged 8 years in 2002) who met the surveillance case definition for ASD. 81% of the sample were male. The population included children with ASD (n = 2,568) and was based on a population-based surveillance study.  

**Intervention:**  
- Evaluation and diagnosis of ASD, including the timing of identification (age of diagnosis, age of first developmental evaluation).  

**Comparator:**  
- Sex of the child (male vs. female).
