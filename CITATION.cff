  This repository contains the code, auxiliary scripts, and
  derived data used in the Final Course Project in
  Biomedical Engineering, whose objective is to evaluate the
  methodological quality of evidence syntheses generated by
  Large Language Models (LLMs), using the PICOS framework.


  The study investigates the extent to which LLMs can
  methodologically reconstruct a synthesis of evidence
  previously consolidated from the scientific literature,
  maintaining strict control over input data, generation
  parameters, prompts, and evaluation criteria.
